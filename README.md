# Graph algorithms course

This repository consists of solutions for graph algorithms course at AGH UST. Every task is in a separate folder. Solutions were written using Python. Each folder contains a task description in Polish.

## Short descriptions of given tasks
- lab 1: finding the most expensive path in a graph
- lab 2: max-flow algorithm
- lab 3: minimum cut problem using max-flow and Stoer-Wagner algorithm
- lab 4: detecting chordal graphs, finding the greatest clique in graph, calculating chromatic number of graph, the minimum vertex cover problem
- project 1: minimum cost of planning K performances.
