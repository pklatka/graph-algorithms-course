# Graph algorithms course

This repository consists of solutions for graph algorithms course at AGH UST. Every task is in a separate folder. Solutions were written using Python. Each folder contains a task description in Polish.

## Short descriptions of given tasks
- [lab1](https://github.com/pklatka/graph-algorithms-course/tree/main/lab1): finding the most expensive path in a graph
- [lab2](https://github.com/pklatka/graph-algorithms-course/tree/main/lab2): max-flow algorithm
- [lab3](https://github.com/pklatka/graph-algorithms-course/tree/main/lab3): minimum cut problem using max-flow and Stoer-Wagner algorithm
- [lab4](https://github.com/pklatka/graph-algorithms-course/tree/main/lab4): detecting chordal graphs, finding the greatest clique in graph, calculating chromatic number of graph, the minimum vertex cover problem
- [project1](https://github.com/pklatka/graph-algorithms-course/tree/main/project1): minimum cost of planning K performances
